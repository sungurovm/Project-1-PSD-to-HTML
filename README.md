   <p>Central air conditioning helps you keep your environment cool and reduces
   humidity levels. Asi the central air conditioning system draws air out of
   various rooms in your house or business through return air ducts the air is
   pulled through an air, filter which removed airborne particles such as dust
   and lint. The filtred air is then routed to air supply ductwork that carries
   it back to the rooms.</p>
